# Axioms of Adaptivity Formalization in Lean

This repository contains a partial Lean formalization
of the AFEM optimality proof given in _Axioms of adaptivity_ by
_C. Carstensen, M. Feischl, M. Page, D. Praetorius_ ([Link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.camwa.2013.12.003)).

It is part of my bachelors thesis _Formalizing Optimal Convergence of Adaptive FEM in Lean_.
